//The code above don't work because to keep the two banana separate, you will now have to name then differently like banana1, banana2. This gets redundant when you have like 10 bananas

// The code below we now use symbol to solve the problem

//each property is a unique Symbol and the first banana doesnâ€™t get overwritten by the second banana.
